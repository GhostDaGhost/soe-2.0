                    <font style="font-weight: bold; color:white; text-decoration: underline;">Why Do Crime?</font><br>
                    <p style="color:white">Sometimes your character fully or partly disobeys the laws of the state. There are several criminal activites that can help you on your journey through the city... that is if you are a criminal.
                    Don't get caught by the police! Depending on the severity of the activity you do, you could end up with fines and jail time! When in jail, you'll have job options to reduce your time or get rid of that boredom!</p>
                    <br>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net//blips/radar_safehouse.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">Houses can be broken into. Right now there are two areas where you may break into and loot houses: Mirror Park and Fudge Lane. Inside you may find surprises tho!
                    Be careful as the police can be notified of a break-in through the security system and respond! If they choose to, they can breach into the property too!</p>
                    <br>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net//blips/radar_warehouse.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">You can break into warehouses and steal cargo loot! Once inside, you have many crates to loot. Be careful as the police may be notified of the intrusion and respond!</p>
                    <br>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net//blips/radar_sports_car.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">There are several chop shops located around the island. You can try to find them by asking around or going exploring. When at one, speak to the chop master through F2 and get the hotlist.
                    Once you find the vehicle, do whatever you need to do to obtain it and turn it in at the chop shop through F2 when arrived.</p>
                    <br>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net//blips/radar_financier_strand.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">There are banks scattered all over the island. All of them besides Pacific Standard at the moment are robbable. Take some time to prepare and be ready to face your consequences if caught. Go to the teller and aim
                    a gun and hit E to begin robbing them! The teller may decide to give in and hand you money or he will hit the deck and be protected behind his counter and bulletproof window. Opening a vault will randomize the need for a certain bank access card. For example: Sometimes a bank will ask for a certain colored bank access card.
                    You will need to find that, or use it if you already have one and find a bank vault panel key. Once you have the required color card and key, you press E to the panel and you'll begin opening the vault. Once the vault is opened, you have many markers once you enter the vault area. Go to any of them and press E to start the drilling process.
                    You have a chance to get a keycard for the next big bank from a deposit box! Fleeca > Banham > Paleto > Pacific
                    </p>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net//blips/radar_rampage.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">Hit Contracts! There is currently one place around the south-side of the city area to grab a hit contract. You will be assigned a target with possible locations and description. The target is in one of the three possible locations.
                    Your goal is to eliminate that target to fulfill the contract. The target can fight back or escape. If you fail to kill the target, you can go back to the starting point and cancel the contract. If the target is murdered, you can go back and collect your payment.
                    There is a 15 minute cooldown between contracts. One cop has to be online to do these contracts.
                    </p>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net//blips/radar_package.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">Drug runs are a risky but good move-around activity. You can choose to run weed, cocaine or crack for a local gang. Get to the dropoffs without getting caught or losing the drugs or else you risk decreasing your reputation.
                    The more reputation you have, the more product and money you get. You'll have a couple dropoffs before needing to go collect your pay.</p>
                    <br>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net//blips/radar_mask.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">Kidnapping is a essential way to force someone to do something you want to do. Whether it'd be for a robbery or revenge. You can place people inside trunks or even place a bag over their head.
                    Do /headbag on the nearest player if you have a bag item in your inventory to cover their face. Do it again if you want to remove the bag. If the target isn't cuffed, they can remove the bag themselves by doing /headbag.
                    Make sure to hold or escort or carry the target to do /putintrunk on the nearest vehicle.</p>

                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">You can rob parking meters by hitting F2 while facing one. You need a crowbar.</p>
                    <br>

                    <img src="https://docs.fivem.net/blips/radar_playerstate_partner.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
                    <p style="color:white; margin: 10px;">You can rob vending machines by hitting F2 while facing one. You need a drill and some drill bits. You can get cash and a bunch of snacks relevant to the machine.</p>
