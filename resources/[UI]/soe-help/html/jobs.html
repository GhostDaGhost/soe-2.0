                    <p style="color:white">In order to live long and prosper, you'll need some kind of income. The typical choice for most people is to get a job and get a paycheck. This can be done one of two ways. You can either apply for and work for a player-owned company or
                        business, which you can find job advertisements for on the forums, or you can work for a local company doing any number of things. Below are some ways you can make money without being employed by another player.</p>
                    <br>
